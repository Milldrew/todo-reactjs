Current things I need to do:
Breakdown code into modular components. Document each component.
After the components are broken down into smaller modules
Create Color Themes
After the color themes are in place work in spacing position and
responsive design.
Mental-Model:

Create the main component. The main component consists of two states. The todolists
state and the todolist state.

The todo-lists state is a grid of all the todo lists with the option to create a new
todo-list or edit the existing todo-lists.

The todolist state shows the todos of a todolist and has the option to create more todos
or to edit todos.

Steps:
Create a component that is positioned in the center.
Create a Todolists data grid which lists all of the names of the grid
Create two buttons one for editing and one for creating a new todo.
Create a modal that allows you to enter the name of your todo list
When the todo list name is entered:
  Add an entry to the todolists grid and create a new todolist
  Use the name of the todolist as a key to store the todo lists in an Object in memory
When to todolist name change the route and render a component that is retrieved from
the object that contains the todlists.
