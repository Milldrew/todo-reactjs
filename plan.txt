Mental-Model:

Create the main component. The main component consists of two states. The todolists
state and the todolist state.

The todo-lists state is a grid of all the todo lists with the option to create a new
todo-list or edit the existing todo-lists.

The todolist state shows the todos of a todolist and has the option to create more todos
or to edit todos.

Steps:
Create a component that is positioned in the center.
Create a Todolists data grid which lists all of the names of the grid
Create two buttons one for editing and one for creating a new todo.
Create a modal that allows you to enter the name of your todo list
When the todo list name is entered:
  Add an entry to the todolists grid and create a new todolist
  Use the name of the todolist as a key to store the todo lists in an Object in memory
When to todolist name change the route and render a component that is retrieved from
the object that contains the todlists.
